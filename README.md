# LeetCode Solutions (Python)

Hi 👋 I'm Thrilok.  
This repository contains all my **LeetCode problem solutions** that I’m solving to improve my **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** skills.

I use **Python** for most of the problems.  
I try to write clean and easy-to-understand code, along with comments explaining my logic.
